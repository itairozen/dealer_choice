Good job, Itai! This is nicely done. I left a comment in your server.js file about some of your html. For future assignments, I would try to work on making more advanced models. Try to model something that actually exists, like episodes of your favorite TV shows, cars you like, restaurants you've visited, etc. It'll really help you learn how to set up database models if you model something real.
